# C++ Enemy AI Demo

This is a simple C++ demo showcasing:

- **Polymorphism** via a base `Enemy` class and two types of enemies (`Zombie`, `Robot`)
- A basic **AI state machine** with states: `Idle`, `Attack`, `Dead`
- A stub for future **pathfinding** logic using a `Pathfind()` function

This project is part of my journey to grow as a game systems and AI developer.

## How to Build

Use Visual Studio (or g++) to build and run:
- Compile `main.cpp`, `Enemy.cpp`
- Make sure `Enemy.h` is in the same directory
